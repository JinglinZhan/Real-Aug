# Real-Aug: Realistic Scene Synthesis for LiDAR Augmentation in 3D Object Detection
This is the official implementation of **Real-Aug**. 
In this work, we reveal the realisticness issue of vanilla synthesis-based LiDAR data augmentation and present a well-designed Real-Aug scheme. The proposed approaches are detector-agnostic and extra data-free. We hope that this work can draw more attention to the data aspect of 3D object detection.
